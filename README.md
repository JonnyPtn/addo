# sudo

This is a program for windows which lets you run terminal commands in the current window with elevated permissions

UAC is still required, unfortunately. Example of it in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0d89sDNk30)

This is still experimental, so don't expect a bug free experience, and I welcome any feedback.

## Compiling
Compile the two source files into two executables using the compiler of your choice, then place the sudo executable somewhere in your PATH environment variable, and put pipedcmd.exe in "C:/sudo" folder (I haven't established a better method for installation yet... open to suggestions)

If you use the command line and want to place the files somewhere requiring administrator permissions check out my sudo program [here](https://github.com/JonnyPtn/sudo/)
